Measurement of Passing in the Ontario Hockey League

- Open the RMD file
- Run the library and code chunks that pull and clean the data (i.e., do not load anything yet)
- Open pass_bart. Inspiration from Asmae Toumi's Big Data Bowl submission. 
- Run the script. It will save a number of items that you can call into the RMD afterwards.
- Knit the RMD file.
